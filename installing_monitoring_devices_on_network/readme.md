About representation of the problem:
Three modes of representation should be considered:
    - one where the network is composed of nodes each having an adjacency (a.k.a: list of all adjecent nodes);
    - one where the network is composed solely of segments (each segment is defined by two ends/nodes);
    - an hybrid one, meaning one with both segments and nodes, it might seem redundant, but it can offer some facility.

We will modelize the problem by resorting to the third mode of representation.
